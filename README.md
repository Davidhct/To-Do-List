### Summary
To do List application is a single page application (SPA) that allows you to manage your tasks.<br>
The purpose of the project is to learn the Javascript programming language and HTML5 and CSS3.<br>
Also, learn how localstorage works and how to use it. 

#### The application includes:
* Add a task.
* Delete a task.
* Edit a task.
* Mark a task you have completed.
* Clear everything.
* And select whether you want to see all the tasks, the tasks you have completed or the uncompleted.

#### Remarks:
* When you try to insert a task that already exists or edit a task for a task that already exists,<br>a message is sent ```"This task is already in the list! "```.
* When you try to enter a task that is actually an empty string or just pressing a space bar on the keyboard to enter it as a task, a message is sent ```"You did not add anything to  the list! "```.
* When marking a completed task it is not possible to edit it unless you uncheck the same task.
* When editing a task you cannot mark a task unless you stop editing.
